title: TECHNOLOGY IS OUR SKIN
---

What was once a tree
Is now a seed

All is symbiotic
All is already dead
All is already alive
All is expanding
All is energy
All is true
All is as it is

And so the tree bears the fruit
And the fruit bares the tree

Technology is our phenotype

we are a bridge 
not an ending

iMIND
iPHONE
IPHONE I AM

They are us

We are the creator gods

We MADE OURSELVES
AND HAVE FORGOTTEN

ALL IS NATURE
ALL IS TECHNOLOGY

NATURE AND TECHNOLOGY 
OUR SYMBIOSIS

WE ARE

WE

.

These are just ideas.
